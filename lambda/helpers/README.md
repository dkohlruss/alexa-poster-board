# Bort!

Bort is an anonymous localized messaging skill developed for Amazon Alexa, which takes advantage of a reddit-like voting system to ensure users are fed the most popular and recent messages, or Borts, first.  

## What's a Bort?

A Bort can be anything that a user deems important to tell others in their area.  It can be a short bit of information about something happening in the area, or it can just be a silly joke or quip.  Borting is also a verb to describe the act of sending a Bort. Bort, incidentally, is also an incredibly popular name for children.

## How to Bort

If you do not have an Alexa-enabled device, visit the [Alexa Skill Testing Tool](https://echosim.io) after enabling the Bort skill on your Amazon account.  State "Open Bort" to open your Bortal to the world of Borting.  You can work through an optional tutorial by following voice prompts which will lead you through Bort.

### The Tech

This skill was written in NodeJS and takes advantage of Amazon's proprietary DynamoDB database system, as well as AWS's Lambda Function service.
